# Unity Auto Save
Add a simple auto save feature to Unity which fires every set interval. 

### User guide<br>
Put <b>TarodevAutoSave.cs</b> & <b>AutoSaveConfig.cs.cs</b> inside an <b>Editor</b> folder anywhere in your project and it'll generate a configuration file in Assets. You can place this config file anywhere, it won't break.

### Disclaimer
Unity could easily implement auto-save functionality, but they haven't for whatever reason. Treat that as a word of warning... It's worked perfectly fine for me without any problems, but I can't guarantee anything.
