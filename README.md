# Unity Auto Save
Add a simple auto save feature to Unity which fires every set interval. 

### User guide<br>
Put this script anywhere in your project and it'll generate a configuration file at the root of your project. You can place this anywhere and it'll work just fine. 

### Disclaimer
Unity could easily implement auto-save functionality, but they haven't for whatever reason. Treat that as a word of warning... It's worked perfectly fine for me without any problems, but I can't guarantee anything.
